         <h2>Main Attractions</h2>
         <p>
            Seattle has so many amazing attractions it's hard to limit them down to a few.
            Here are a few of the many amazing attractions Seattle is known for:
         </p>
            <ul>
               <li>Space Needle</li>
               <li>Pike Place Market</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Space Needle</h3>
            <p>
               The Space Needle in Seattle, Washington, is an iconic and fascinating structure with several cool features and historical significance.
               The Space Needle stands 605 feet tall, making it the tallest structure in Seattle.
               Its unique design features a slender, futuristic tower with a flying saucer-like observation deck at the top.
               The Space Needle was built for the 1962 World’s Fair, also known as the Century 21 Exposition.
               Nearly 10 million people visited the fair, and the Space Needle served as its main attraction and centerpiece.
               The idea for the Space Needle was inspired by the Stuttgart TV Tower in Germany.
               Edward E. Carlson, one of the masterminds behind the Space Needle, saw the Stuttgart tower during his travels and decided to create a similar landmark for Seattle.
               Initially, Carlson’s design featured a giant balloon tethered to the ground, with the tower built on top of it.
               Architect John Graham Jr. introduced the concept of a revolving restaurant and observation deck, which became the iconic feature we know today.
               The Space Needle’s rotating restaurant, called SkyCity, completes a full rotation every 47 minutes.
               The Space Needle has 25 lightning rods on its roof to protect against lightning strikes.

            <h3>Pike Place Market</h3>
            <p>
               Pike Place Market in Seattle, Washington, is a vibrant and historic landmark that has captured the hearts of locals and visitors alike.
               Whether you’re shopping for fresh produce, enjoying a meal, or simply soaking in the lively ambiance, Pike Place Market continues to be a beloved cultural destination in Seattle! 
               Pike Place Market began in response to an exorbitant swell in the price of fresh produce during the early 20th century.
               City Councilman Thomas Plummer Revelle fought against price gouging and identified an unused ordinance that allowed the city to set aside land for public markets.
               On August 17, 1907, Pike Place Market was officially founded, overlooking the industrial waterfront.
               Pike Place Market remains one of the oldest continuously operated public farmers’ markets in the United States.
               It serves as a place of business for small farmers, craftspeople, and merchants, creating a unique and bustling atmosphere.

         </p>
            <ul>
               <li>Discovery Park</li>
               <li>Mount Rainer</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Discovery Park</h3>
            <p>
               Discovery Park in Seattle, Washington, is a captivating natural area that offers a blend of breathtaking beauty, historical significance, and outdoor exploration.
               Situated on Magnolia Bluff, Discovery Park provides panoramic views of both the Cascade and Olympic Mountain ranges.
               The park boasts two miles of protected tidal beaches.
               The park’s role is to provide an open space of quiet and tranquility away from the stress and activity of the city.
               Shortly after the Point Elliot Treaty of 1885, the area became a US military base for nearly 80 years.
               In 1965, Congressman Brock Adams introduced a bill to cede ownership of the military land to the City of Seattle, envisioning it as a city park.
               The park’s creation was also influenced by the United Indians People’s Council, who claimed rights under 1865 US-Indian treaties.
               Whether you’re hiking the trails, visiting the historic lighthouse, or simply enjoying the natural beauty, Discovery Park offers an unmatched opportunity to connect with nature and history.

               With its 14,410 feet in elevation, Mount Rainier easily towers over smaller rivals in the Cascade Range.
               It is the most heavily glaciered peak in the lower 48 states, boasting 25 major glaciers and over 35 square miles of permanent ice and snow cover.
               The park’s Paradise area averages an astonishing 639 inches of snow per year. 
               That’s equivalent to 53 feet of snow annually!
               Mount Rainier National Park boasts over 150 waterfalls.
               Among them, the 300-foot-tall Comet Falls stands out, plunging off a cliff into a rocky meadow ravine.
               Whether you’re exploring glaciers, hiking through wildflower meadows, or marveling at waterfalls, Mount Rainier offers an unforgettable experience for nature enthusiasts!

         <h2>Hidden Gems</h2>
         <p>
            Seattle is full of hidden gems waiting to be discovered. 
            Here are some lesser-known spots that offer unique experiences:
         </p>
            <ul>
               <li>Fremont Troll</li>
               <li>Beacon Food Forest</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Fremont Troll</h3>
            <p>
               The Fremont Troll, also known as the Troll Under the Bridge, is a fascinating public sculpture located in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle, Washington.
               The Fremont Troll is a mixed-media colossal statue that stands 18 feet (5.5 meters) high. 
               It’s situated on N. 36th Street at Troll Avenue N., right under the north end of the George Washington Memorial Bridge (also known as the Aurora Bridge). 
               The most eye-catching detail? The troll is clutching an actual Volkswagen Beetle, as if it had just swiped it from the roadway above. 
               The vehicle even has a California license plate! Originally, the car held a time capsule, including a plaster bust of Elvis Presley, but unfortunately, it was stolen during an act of vandalism.
               The Fremont Troll was sculpted by four local artists: Steve Badanes, Will Martin, Donna Walter, and Ross Whitehead. 
               The idea of a troll living under a bridge draws inspiration from Scandinavian (Norwegian) folklore. 
               Interestingly, the artists hold the copyright to the Troll images, and they’ve taken legal action against businesses that use its image commercially without permission. However, postcards, beer, and other products featuring the Troll are available for non-profit organizations.
            </p>
            <h3>Beacon Food Forest</h3>
            <p>
               The Beacon Food Forest is a remarkable community-run project located in Seattle, Washington.
               The Beacon Food Forest covers approximately 7 acres and is situated adjacent to Jefferson Park on Beacon Hill. 
               It’s a unique urban food forest that combines agroforestry and permaculture design principles.
               The food forest mimics a woodland ecosystem by integrating edible trees, shrubs, perennials, and annuals. 
               These plants are thoughtfully positioned to support mutual growth and sustainability.
               The project is community-driven, with volunteers actively maintaining and managing the space. 
               It’s a place where people come together to grow food, learn from each other, and build connections.
